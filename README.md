# IPChecker

Checks IP in comparison to IP from 30 seconds ago and if it's different will notify the user via the FlashWindowEx function.

My personal use for this application is because I host my own website from my local PC and so if my IP changes I need to update my Domain DNS settings to point to the new IP.
